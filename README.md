## Quick start
```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Build installers
```bash
npm run pack
npm run build
```

macOS helper:
- `./mac_diagtool_program_builder.sh`
- Note: I made an auto builder for macOS, but I could not build it myself.

## Where the executables are
- Output folder: `dist/`
- Windows installer: `*.exe` (NSIS)
- macOS installer: `*.dmg`
- macOS builds are best done on macOS (I don't have a Mac).
- Tests run before push; releases are on GitHub.
- The mac helper script generates `assets/icon-mac.icns` from `assets/icon-mac.png` before building.
